# EDA-Advanced_House_Price_Prediction

This GitHub repository hosts the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the Advanced House Price Prediction project. In this project, we aim to predict housing prices using a dataset containing various features related to residential properties.

The EDA phase is a crucial step in understanding the data, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the factors that influence house prices. This repository includes Jupyter notebooks, data files, and visualizations that provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset.

### Key Highlights:

1. Comprehensive data exploration and visualization to uncover trends and relationships.
2. Identification of potential outliers and data preprocessing steps.
3. Statistical analysis and insights into the dataset's key features.
4. Visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
5. Code and documentation for reproducibility and transparency.

This EDA phase serves as the foundation for subsequent steps in the house price prediction project, such as feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Feel free to explore the findings and insights in this repository, and use them as a reference for the rest of the project.
